**Romper** is a cross-platform desktop application designed to streamline sample kit management for the **Squarp Rample** ‚Äî a 4-voice Eurorack sampler module. Whether you're a producer working with hundreds of samples or a live performer who needs quick access to perfectly organized kits, Romper provides an intuitive interface for managing, auditioning, and organizing your sample libraries.

## üéØ What is Romper?

The **Squarp Rample** is a powerful 4-voice sampler in Eurorack format that reads samples from SD cards organized in a specific folder structure. While the Rample itself is excellent, managing large sample libraries, creating kits, and keeping everything organized can become tedious when working directly with files and folders.

**Romper solves this by providing:**
- A **visual interface** for browsing and organizing sample kits
- **Audio preview** with built-in playback and step sequencer
- **Safe sample management** that never modifies your original files
- **Kit editing tools** with drag-and-drop sample assignment
- **Batch operations** for organizing large sample libraries
- **Format validation** to ensure compatibility with your Rample hardware

Built with modern web technologies (**Electron**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **Drizzle ORM**), Romper brings the convenience of modern music software to hardware sample management.

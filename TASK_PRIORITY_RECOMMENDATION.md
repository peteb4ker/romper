# Task Priority Recommendations

## Critical Path Analysis

Based on dependency analysis and current codebase state, here's the recommended task execution order:

## Phase 1: Foundation (IMMEDIATE)

### 1.1 Complete ORM Migration (BLOCKING)
**Current Issue**: Task 13.0 is deferred but affects all database operations.

```markdown
Priority Tasks:
- [ ] 3.5.4 Add comprehensive TypeScript error handling
- [ ] 13.1 Install and configure Drizzle ORM  
- [ ] 13.2 Replace existing database operations
- [ ] 13.3 Enhance database schema (add source_path field)
- [ ] 13.4 Fresh database initialization
```

**Why Critical**: All kit editing functionality depends on proper ORM implementation.

### 1.2 Resolve Technical Debt (BLOCKING)
**Current Issue**: "Complete" sections have pending sub-tasks that may block new features.

```markdown
Priority Tasks:
- [ ] 2.2.1 Move play control and BPM label to left of grid
- [ ] 2.2.2 Update sequencer to work with reference-only architecture  
- [ ] 2.2.3 Integrate with voice_number field for accurate sample mapping
```

**Why Critical**: Sequencer updates needed for reference-only architecture consistency.

## Phase 2: Core Functionality (HIGH PRIORITY)

### 2.1 Kit Editing System Foundation
```markdown
- [ ] 5.1 Implement editable mode system
  - [ ] 5.1.1 Default ON for user kits, OFF for factory kits
  - [ ] 5.1.2 Manual toggle control with persistence
  - [ ] 5.1.3 Visual indicators and UI feedback  
  - [ ] 5.1.4 Unit tests for editable mode
```

### 2.2 Reference-Only Sample Management
```markdown
- [ ] 5.2 Implement reference-only sample management
  - [ ] 5.2.1 Store external samples via source_path field
  - [ ] 5.2.2 Drag-and-drop sample assignment
  - [ ] 5.2.3 Add/Replace/Delete operations with source_path tracking
  - [ ] 5.2.4 12-slot limit per voice using voice_number field
  - [ ] 5.2.5 Unit tests for sample management
```

## Phase 3: Format and Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### 3.1 WAV Format Validation
```markdown
- [ ] 6.1 Implement WAV format validation for reference files
- [ ] 6.2 Implement format warning system  
- [ ] 6.3 Implement format conversion during SD card sync
```

### 3.2 Stereo Sample Handling
```markdown
- [ ] 7.1 Implement 'default to mono samples' global setting
- [ ] 7.2 Implement stereo assignment logic with voice_number
- [ ] 7.3 Implement stereo conflict resolution
```

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (LOWER PRIORITY)

### 4.1 SD Card Sync Operations
```markdown
- [ ] 8.1-8.5 Complete sync workflow implementation
```

### 4.2 Undo/Redo System  
```markdown
- [ ] 9.1-9.4 Complete action history implementation
```

### 4.3 UI Enhancements
```markdown
- [ ] 10.1-12.3 Enhanced interfaces and settings
```

## Rationale for Reordering

### Why ORM Migration First?
1. **Foundation Dependency**: All database operations need proper ORM patterns
2. **Type Safety**: Current database code may lack proper TypeScript integration
3. **Architecture Consistency**: Ensures DbResult<T> pattern is properly implemented
4. **Technical Debt**: Prevents accumulating more inconsistent database code

### Why Fix "Complete" Sections?
1. **Architectural Consistency**: Sequencer needs reference-only architecture
2. **User Experience**: Play controls and BPM display affect usability
3. **Data Integrity**: voice_number field integration prevents data inconsistencies
4. **Testing Foundation**: Ensures existing features work with new architecture

### Why Kit Editing Next?
1. **Core Feature**: Primary user value proposition
2. **Foundation for Others**: Most other features depend on kit editing
3. **User Journey**: Enables the main "Kit Creation and Management Journey"
4. **Development Momentum**: Provides visible progress on core functionality

## Implementation Strategy

### Suggested Approach
1. **Complete Phase 1** before starting any Phase 2 tasks
2. **Integrate testing** throughout rather than deferring to end
3. **User approval** after each sub-task as per current process
4. **Validation gates** using TypeScript, tests, and standards compliance

### Risk Mitigation
- **Dependency Validation**: Check prerequisites before each task
- **Incremental Progress**: Small, validated steps prevent large regressions
- **Standards Compliance**: Use .agent/ context-aware standards throughout
- **User Feedback**: Regular approval checkpoints maintain project direction

# Developer Setup

These instructions are for developers who want to work on Romper itself.

## Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snarktank/romper.git
cd romper
npm install
```

## Run in Development Mode

Open two terminals:

```bash
npm run dev
```

and in the second terminal:

```bash
npm run start
```

Electron will launch and connect to the Vite dev server for hot reloading.

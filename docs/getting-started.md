# Getting Started

This page walks you through installing Romper, connecting your SD card, and creating your first kit plan.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release for your operating system from the
   [Romper Releases page](https://github.com/peteb4ker/romper/releases).
2. Extract the archive and run the **Romper** application.

For contributors who want to work on the codebase, see
[Developer Setup](./development.md).

## Loading Your SD Card

1. Insert the Rample SD card into your computer.
2. When Romper starts, choose **Load from SD Card**. The app scans the standard Rample structure:
   - `KITS/`
   - `SAMPLES/`
   - `.rample_labels.json`
3. Existing kits, samples, and metadata appear in the **Kit Browser**.

## Creating a New Kit Plan

1. Click **New Kit** in the top bar.
2. Choose a bank (A–Z) and slot (00–99). The kit appears in the browser.
3. Open the kit to assign samples and set up voices.

Continue reading the [Kit Browser](./kit-browser.md) guide for navigation details.

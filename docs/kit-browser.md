# Kit Browser

The Kit Browser is the main landing view. Kits are organized by bank (A–Z) and slot (00–99).

## Navigating Banks and Kits

- Use the **A–Z hotkeys** to jump between banks. Focus moves to the first kit in that bank.
- Arrow keys let you move through the kit grid.
- `Enter` opens the selected kit.
- Disabled back/forward buttons prevent navigation past the first or last kit.

Each kit card shows:

- The **kit ID** (e.g., `A0`).
- The kit **name** from `.rample_labels.json`.
- A kit type icon (Drum, Loop, Vocal, FX, or Synth).
- Sample counts for each voice. Empty voices display in red, partially filled voices in light green, and full voices in bold green.
- Labels of detected voice names.
- Lock icon if the kit is protected.

## Creating, Duplicating, and Deleting Kits

- Use the **New Kit** button to create a blank kit plan.
- Choose **Duplicate Kit** to copy the current kit plan to another bank/slot.
- Locked kits cannot be overwritten until unlocked.

Next, see [Kit Details](./kit-details.md) for assigning samples and editing voices.

# Settings

Romper includes several global preferences that persist between launches.

## Theme

- Toggle between **Light** and **Dark** mode using the switch in the top bar.
- The chosen theme is saved and restored automatically.

## Stereo as Mono

- **Treat Stereo as Mono** is enabled by default. When on, stereo samples occupy two slots during sync and can be automatically converted to mono.
- Disable this option if you want to keep stereo playback when syncing.

## Volume Control

- Adjust the global preview volume using the slider in the status bar.

Settings are stored locally in SQLite and do not require an internet connection.

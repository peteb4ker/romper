# Syncing Kits to SD Card

Romper copies your kit plans and samples to the mounted SD card. Syncing is only available when the card is present.

## Prerequisites

- A valid Rample SD card inserted and mounted.
- All required samples present; missing files block sync.
- Invalid kits (wrong file names or duplicates per voice) cannot be synced.

## Sync Workflow

1. Click **Sync** in the top bar. Romper validates every kit.
2. If destructive sync is enabled, you must confirm before files are overwritten. A local backup is created.
3. Progress is shown in the status bar. Large tasks such as mono conversion display a percentage.
4. Upon completion, kits and metadata are copied to the SD card.

## Factory Samples

Choose **Restore Factory Kits** to download the official sample pack and replace the existing factory folders. Romper shows warnings and progress indicators during this operation.

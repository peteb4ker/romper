# Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues when using Romper.

## Missing Samples

- If a kit references a file that cannot be found, a warning appears at the top of the app and the kit cannot be synced.
- Reassign the missing file or remove it from the kit to continue.

## Invalid File Warnings

- Only `.wav` files are accepted. Dragging other formats will show an error message.
- Duplicate samples within a voice are blocked. Across voices, duplicates are allowed but a warning is shown.

## SD Card Removal

- If the SD card is removed during sync, the process pauses and an error is displayed.
- Reinsert the card to resume or cancel the operation.

## Factory Restore Errors

- Ensure you have an internet connection if restoring factory kits, as Romper downloads the sample pack.
- Disk space is required to unzip and copy the files.

If you encounter issues not listed here, please open a GitHub issue with steps to reproduce.

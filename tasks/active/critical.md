# Critical Tasks - v1.0.0 Blockers

Tasks that must be completed before v1.0.0 release.

---

## SYNC.1: Bulletproof SD Card Sync
**Priority:** Critical | **Status:** Active | **Target:** v1.0.0

**Previously:** Task 24.0

### Description
Debug and fix SD card sync functionality to ensure reliable operation for release.

### Subtasks
- [ ] SYNC.1.1 Test sync workflow end-to-end to identify failure points
- [ ] SYNC.1.2 Debug syncService.ts methods and error handling
- [ ] SYNC.1.3 Test IPC communication for sync operations
- [ ] SYNC.1.4 Verify file operations and conversion during sync
- [ ] SYNC.1.5 Fix any identified issues preventing successful sync

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] SYNC.1.6 Unit tests: Test syncService individual methods (validation, copying, conversion)
- [ ] SYNC.1.7 Integration tests: Test IPC handlers for sync operations and progress tracking
- [ ] SYNC.1.8 E2E tests: Complete sync workflow from UI selection to SD card verification

### Success Criteria
- All sync operations complete successfully without errors
- File format conversion works correctly
- Progress tracking displays accurately
- Error handling provides clear user feedback
- All tests pass

## QA.1: Pre-release Testing & Validation
**Priority:** Critical | **Status:** Active | **Target:** v1.0.0

**Previously:** Task 25.0

### Description
Comprehensive quality assurance testing before v1.0.0 release.

### Testing Areas
- [ ] QA.1.1 **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user journey testing (setup → kit creation → sync)
- [ ] QA.1.2 **Regression Testing**: Ensure all existing functionality still works
- [ ] QA.1.3 **Performance Testing**: Test with realistic data sets (100+ kits)
- [ ] QA.1.4 **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verify functionality on Windows, macOS, Linux
- [ ] QA.1.5 **Error Handling**: Test edge cases, corrupted files, network issues

### Release Preparation
- [ ] QA.1.6 **Documentation**: Update README, user guides, changelog
- [ ] QA.1.7 **Version Bumping**: Update package.json, electron-builder config
- [ ] QA.1.8 **Build Testing**: Test production builds on all platforms
- [ ] QA.1.9 **Distribution**: Prepare release artifacts, code signing
- [ ] QA.1.10 **Release Notes**: Document features, bug fixes, known issues

### Success Criteria
- All critical user journeys work without issues
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
- Production builds generate successfully
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Release artifacts are properly signed and distributed

---

## Status Dashboard

### Current Status: ✅ READY FOR RELEASE
- **Build**: ✅ Successful (all platforms compile)
- **Unit Tests**: ✅ Passing (175 files, 2187 tests, 80.7% coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: ✅ Passing (8 files, 115 tests)
- **Core Features**: ✅ Complete (kit editing, undo/redo, sync, UI/UX)
- **Navigation**: ✅ Working 100% (verified)

### Remaining Work
- **SYNC.1**: SD Card sync reliability verification
- **QA.1**: Final pre-release validation

---

## Notes

### Priority Rationale
These tasks are marked critical because they directly impact the v1.0.0 release:
- SYNC.1 ensures core functionality works reliably
- QA.1 ensures quality standards for public release

### Dependencies
- SYNC.1 must be completed before final QA.1 testing
- Both tasks must be completed before v1.0.0 tag creation

### Resources
- See `/tasks/specs/sd-card-naming.md` for sync implementation details
- See `/tasks/PRD.md` for complete feature requirements
- See `/docs/developer/` for development guidelines

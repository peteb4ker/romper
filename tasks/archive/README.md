# Task Archive

This directory contains completed tasks that have been archived to reduce context size and improve navigation.

## Archive Organization

- **completed-2025-01.md** - All completed tasks from the original task files
- **critical-2025-01.md** - Completed critical v1.0.0 blocker tasks (SYNC.1, QA.1)
- **ux-improvements.md** - Completed UX improvement tasks (Tasks 17-19)
- **technical-debt.md** - Completed technical debt items

## Purpose

These files preserve the history and documentation of completed work while removing them from the active task context. This allows agents and developers to:

1. Focus on current priorities without context clutter
2. Reference completed work when needed
3. Maintain historical records for project documentation

## Navigation

For current active tasks, see:
- `/tasks/active/` - Current priority tasks
- `/tasks/INDEX.md` - Task navigation index
- `/tasks/PRD.md` - Product requirements (reference)

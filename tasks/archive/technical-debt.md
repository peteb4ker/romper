# Archived Technical Debt - Completed Items

This file contains completed technical debt items that were archived to reduce context size.

---

## ✅ Code Quality (Completed Items)

### ✅ Remove trailing whitespace from codebase
- **Priority**: High | **Effort**: Small | **Risk**: None
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Completion Details**:
  - Cleaned trailing whitespace from 3 affected files
  - Added ESLint `no-trailing-spaces` rule to prevent future issues
  - Codebase now clean, automated prevention in place

### ✅ Refactor duplicated error handling patterns
- **Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Low
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Completion Details**:
  - Created lightweight error handling utilities and patterns
  - Added `ErrorPatterns` to `app/renderer/utils/errorHandling.ts` with standard patterns
  - Created `createRendererErrorHandler()` function for components requiring custom error handling
  - Extended `shared/errorUtils.ts` with `SampleError`, `KitError`, `ValidationError` classes
  - Centralized error handling mock in `tests/mocks/errorHandling.ts`
  - **Files Updated**: `useSampleProcessing.ts`, `useStereoHandling.ts`, `useSampleActions.ts`, `useInternalDragHandlers.ts`, `useKitDetailsLogic.ts`
  - **Results**: Reduced code duplication, standardized console.error + toast.error patterns across renderer hooks
  - **Approach**: Lightweight solution without heavyweight frameworks, maintains existing test structure

### ✅ Decompose SampleService class (983-line service now refactored)
- **Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: Large | **Risk**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Completion Details**:
  - Successfully decomposed into focused services:
    - `SampleValidator` - validation logic (voice/slot, file format, stereo constraints)
    - `SampleCrudService` - CRUD operations (add, delete, move samples)
    - `SampleMetadataService` - audio metadata and buffer operations
    - `SampleSlotService` - slot management and boundary validation
  - **Results**: 983-line monolithic service → 4 focused services with comprehensive tests
  - **Approach**: Created orchestrating SampleService that delegates to specialized services
  - **Benefits**: Better separation of concerns, improved testability, clearer responsibility boundaries

## ✅ Testing (Completed Items)

### ✅ Test Infrastructure Overhaul - Phase 1: Foundation
- **Priority**: High | **Effort**: Large | **Risk**: Low
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Completion Details**:
  - Created centralized test infrastructure with tests/ directory
  - Centralized mocks for electron, filesystem, database, browser APIs
  - Test data factories for Kit, Sample, Settings objects
  - Standardized test providers and setup/teardown patterns
  - Addressed growing test complexity and mock duplication (75+ electronAPI instances)

### ✅ Test Infrastructure Migration - Adoption Phase
- **Priority**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Low
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Completion Details**:
  - Successfully migrated 13+ test files from manual mocks to centralized setup
  - Updated vitest.setup.ts to import defaultElectronAPIMock and setupAudioMocks globally
  - **Migrated Files**: 10 test files including:
    - AboutView, KitsView, WizardSourceStep
    - useDb, useKitPlayback, useLocalStoreWizard
    - useStartupActions, useBankScanning, useValidationResults
    - SampleWaveform
  - **Results**: Test count improved from 633 → 639 passing tests, infrastructure now centralized
  - **Approach**: Removed manual window.electronAPI assignments, tests now use global vitest.setup.ts mocks

## ✅ Development Experience (Completed Items)

### ✅ Preserve route state during HMR reloads
- **Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: Small | **Risk**: Low
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Completion Details**:
  - Implemented HMR state preservation with testable functions
  - Created `hmrStateManager.ts` with route and kit selection preservation
  - **Files Updated**: `app/renderer/main.tsx`, `app/renderer/views/KitsView.tsx`
  - **Tests**: 19 comprehensive test cases covering all HMR state management scenarios
  - **Results**: Route and selected kit state now preserved during development hot reloads

---

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Achievements
- **Error Handling Standardization**: Lightweight patterns without heavyweight frameworks
- **Service Decomposition**: 983-line monolith broken into 4 focused services
- **Test Infrastructure**: Centralized mocks and providers for consistent testing
- **Development Experience**: HMR state preservation improves developer workflow

### Approach Philosophy
- **Lightweight Solutions**: Avoid introducing heavyweight frameworks unless necessary
- **Incremental Improvement**: Focus on high-impact, low-risk improvements
- **Test-Driven**: Ensure all refactoring maintains or improves test coverage
- **Developer Experience**: Prioritize improvements that enhance daily development workflow

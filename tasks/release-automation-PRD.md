# Release Automation - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Romper Sample Manager currently uses a manual tag-based release process that requires multiple manual steps and lacks consistency in release notes. This PRD outlines a comprehensive release automation system that maintains manual control over versioning while automating repetitive tasks and ensuring consistent, professional releases.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **Inconsistent Release Notes**: Each release has generic, unchanging content that doesn't reflect actual changes
2. **Manual Process Overhead**: Multiple manual steps required for each release
3. **No Changelog Management**: No automated tracking of changes between releases
4. **Scattered Scripts**: Release-related scripts mixed with other utilities
5. **Limited Validation**: Basic pre-release checks that could miss issues
6. **No Version Management**: Manual package.json updates prone to errors

### Impact

- Release quality varies based on who performs the release
- Time-consuming manual process discourages frequent releases
- Users don't get clear information about what changed
- Potential for release failures due to missed steps

## Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Streamline Release Process**: Single command to orchestrate entire release
2. **Consistent Release Notes**: Template-based system with dynamic content
3. **Automated Change Tracking**: Parse git history to document changes
4. **Robust Validation**: Comprehensive pre-release checks
5. **Organized Tooling**: Dedicated release scripts directory

### Non-Goals

- Semantic versioning based on commit messages (explicitly not wanted)
- Fully automated releases without human oversight
- CI/CD pipeline changes (existing GitHub Actions workflow is sufficient)

## User Stories

### As a Developer

- I want to create a release with a single command
- I want to choose the version number interactively
- I want to preview release notes before publishing
- I want confidence that all checks pass before release

### As a User

- I want to understand what changed in each release
- I want consistent, professional release notes
- I want to know about breaking changes
- I want clear installation instructions

### As a Maintainer

- I want organized, maintainable release scripts
- I want a documented, repeatable process
- I want to track changes across releases
- I want to validate releases before publishing

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Release Command System

- **Interactive CLI** (`npm run release`)
  - Version selection (major/minor/patch)
  - Dry-run mode for testing
  - Release preview before confirmation
  - Rollback capability if needed

#### Release Notes Template

- **Location**: `docs/templates/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Dynamic Sections**:
  - Version and date
  - Changes since last release
  - Breaking changes (if any)
  - New features
  - Bug fixes
  - Performance improvements
  - Known issues
- **Static Sections**:
  - Download instructions per platform
  - Installation guide
  - System requirements
  - Support resources

#### Commit Parsing

- Parse commits since last tag
- Categorize by conventional commit types:
  - `feat:` → New Features
  - `fix:` → Bug Fixes
  - `perf:` → Performance
  - `BREAKING:` → Breaking Changes
  - `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:` → Other Changes
- Include PR references (#123)
- Include issue references (fixes #456)

#### Version Management

- Read current version from package.json
- Suggest next version based on selection
- Update package.json automatically
- Validate version format (semver)
- Check for version conflicts

#### Pre-Release Validation

- All tests pass
- Build succeeds
- No uncommitted changes
- On correct branch (main)
- Remote is up to date
- Required files exist
- Dependencies are correct

#### Changelog Management

- Create/update CHANGELOG.md
- Group changes by version
- Include release date
- Link to GitHub releases
- Maintain historical record

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Organization

- All release scripts in `scripts/release/`
- Clear file naming and structure
- Modular, reusable components
- Comprehensive error handling

#### Performance

- Release process < 2 minutes
- Parallel validation checks
- Efficient git operations
- Minimal network calls

#### Reliability

- Atomic operations (all or nothing)
- Clear error messages
- Recovery mechanisms
- Validation before destructive operations

#### Maintainability

- Well-documented code
- Unit tests for critical functions
- Clear configuration options
- Extensible architecture

## Technical Design

### Architecture

```
scripts/release/
├── index.js              # Main orchestrator
├── validate.js           # Pre-release validation
├── parse-commits.js      # Git commit parser
├── generate-notes.js     # Release notes generator
├── update-version.js     # Version management
├── create-changelog.js   # CHANGELOG.md updater
├── verify-release.js     # Post-release verification
└── utils/
    ├── git.js            # Git operations
    ├── template.js       # Template processing
    └── prompts.js        # Interactive prompts
```

### Data Flow

1. **Initiation**: Developer runs `npm run release`
2. **Validation**: Pre-release checks execute
3. **Version Selection**: Interactive prompt for version
4. **Commit Analysis**: Parse changes since last tag
5. **Notes Generation**: Create release notes from template
6. **Preview**: Show developer what will be released
7. **Confirmation**: Developer approves or cancels
8. **Execution**: Update files, create tag, push
9. **Monitoring**: Watch GitHub Actions progress
10. **Verification**: Confirm release published correctly

### Dependencies

- **inquirer**: Interactive CLI prompts
- **chalk**: Terminal styling
- **simple-git**: Git operations
- **semver**: Version parsing/validation
- **handlebars**: Template processing
- **ora**: Progress spinners

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

1. Create directory structure
2. Move existing validation script
3. Create release notes template
4. Implement basic orchestrator

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)

1. Implement commit parser
2. Build notes generator
3. Create version manager
4. Add changelog support

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 3)

1. Add interactive prompts
2. Implement dry-run mode
3. Add rollback capability
4. Create verification tools

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 4)

1. Comprehensive testing
2. Documentation updates
3. Error handling improvements
4. Performance optimization

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

- Release time reduced by 75%
- Zero failed releases due to process errors
- 100% of releases have detailed notes
- All releases pass validation checks

### Qualitative Metrics

- Developer satisfaction with process
- User feedback on release notes quality
- Maintainer confidence in releases
- Reduced cognitive load for releases

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Breaking Existing Workflow

**Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility, allow manual override

### Risk: Complex Implementation

**Mitigation**: Incremental development, thorough testing

### Risk: Git History Parsing Issues

**Mitigation**: Fallback to manual entry, flexible parsing rules

### Risk: Template Rigidity

**Mitigation**: Customizable templates, override options

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features

1. **Beta/Pre-release Support**: Tag and publish pre-releases
2. **Multi-branch Releases**: Support release branches
3. **Automated Dependency Updates**: Update deps before release
4. **Release Analytics**: Track download metrics
5. **In-app Update Notifications**: Notify users of new versions
6. **GPG Signing**: Sign releases for security
7. **Artifact Checksums**: Generate and verify checksums

### Long-term Vision

Eventually, the release system could become a standalone tool that other Electron projects could adopt, providing a standardized approach to desktop app releases.

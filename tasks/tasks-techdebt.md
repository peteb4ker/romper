## üéØ Current Active Technical Debt

### High Impact / Medium Effort (Priority Items)
1. **DEBT.1**: KitBrowser decomposition (improves maintainability)
2. **DEBT.5**: Complete test infrastructure (improves development workflow)

### Medium Impact / Low Effort
3. **DEBT.2**: WAV analysis to main process (improves user experience)
4. **DEBT.6**: Error path coverage (improves stability)

### Low Priority (As Needed)
5. **DEBT.3**: Server-side validation (only if issues arise)
6. **DEBT.4**: Database profiling (only if performance issues reported)
7. **DEBT.7**: Documentation (ongoing as needed)

## üìã Guidelines for Technical Debt Management

### When to Address
- **Don't tackle** unless specifically prioritized or blocking current work
- **Mark items complete** with `[x]` when finished and move to archive
- **Add new items** when encountering tech debt during feature work
- **Update priorities** based on user feedback and stability issues

### Prioritization Strategy
- **Group related items** and address together for efficiency
- **Consider user impact** when prioritizing
- **Balance** technical improvement with feature development
- **Focus on high-impact, low-risk** improvements first

### Success Metrics
- **Code Maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend
- **Test Quality**: Better coverage and organization
- **Performance**: No degradation, potential improvements
- **Developer Experience**: Reduced friction in development workflow

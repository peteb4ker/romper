# Favorites Bug Fix - Manual Test Verification

## Issue Description
The bug reported was: "when clicking the 'favorites' button in the kit list, the behavior is completely inconsistent. it does not reliably show just the kits that are favorited. if we mark a kit as favorite, then filter just favorites, then unfilter, then unfavorite that kit, then filter favorites again, the recently unfavorited kit is still in the filtered favorites list."

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was in the **state synchronization** between local component state and database state:

1. `useKitFilters` hook managed local favorite states (`kitFavoriteStates`) for immediate UI updates
2. But the filtering logic relied on database state (`kit.is_favorite`) from the `kits` prop
3. There were **two filtering layers** - one in `useKitFilters` and another in `KitBrowser`
4. `KitsView` was passing unfiltered `navigation.sortedKits` instead of `kitFilters.filteredKits`

## Fix Applied

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed filtering logic in `useKitFilters.ts`**:
   - Added `getKitFavoriteStateForFiltering` function that matches the logic of `getKitFavoriteState`
   - Updated `filteredKits` to use local state first, then fallback to database state
   - Added sorting to maintain consistent kit order

2. **Updated `KitsView.tsx`**:
   - Changed to use `kitFilters.filteredKits` instead of `navigation.sortedKits`
   - This ensures single source of truth for filtering

3. **Simplified `KitBrowser.tsx`**:
   - Removed duplicate filtering logic
   - Now just uses the pre-filtered kits from parent
   - Removed unused `useMemo` import

### Key Principle
**Single Source of Truth**: The `useKitFilters` hook is now the only place where filtering logic exists, ensuring consistency between what's displayed and what's filtered.

## Test Scenario
To verify the fix, test this exact sequence:

1. Mark a kit as favorite ✓
2. Filter to show only favorites ✓  
3. Unfilter to show all kits ✓
4. Unfavorite that kit ✓
5. Filter favorites again ✓

**Expected Result**: The recently unfavorited kit should NOT appear in the filtered favorites list.

**Before Fix**: Kit would still appear due to state synchronization issues
**After Fix**: Kit correctly disappears from favorites filter because local state is checked first
